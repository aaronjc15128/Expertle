# Expertle

Remake of the hit game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with difficulty levels, word definitions, and much more.

## Difficulties
There are 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard & Expert.

Normal and Hard modes are the exact same as those in the original Wordle game.

Easy Mode uses the top 10% easiest words used in Normal Mode for solutions.

## Expert Mode
Expert Mode is the usual Wordle but without showing any hints.

This may seem immpossible at a glance, however you are given *some* information.

When inputting a word, you are given the number of yellows and greens in the word, but not the position of them.

Playing the game will give you much more clarity than what this markdown file could ever give :)

## Word Definitions
When completing a game, you will get the definition of the solution word, along with the phonetic, an example and even the history of the word.

Note: Some of this information may not be shown depending on whether the information can be found or not.

## Result Menu
The result menu gives you statistics based on your game.

These include attempts, mode, and time taken.

## Final Note
Hope you enjoy playing this fun take on Wordle.

This was made just for fun and to make Wordle accessible for all users.

Like mentioned in the about menu of the game, if there has been any copyright/trademark infringements, please contact me to ensure that they will be fixed/removed within 72 hours.

Note: The webgame is best experienced on a PC/Laptop.
